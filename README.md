# Front-End Portfolio

This is a portfolio created as part of the course work for Code Fellows 301d8. Goals include successfully displaying project work and using responsive web design/jQuery elements.

## Start Date: March 6,2017

## Technical Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Handlebars.js

## Feature List
#### Single Page Application

There is only one HTML page; jQuery is used to show and hide the portfolio sections as needed. Media queries are used to keep the site responsive. This site was designed with mobile-first in mind; as such, all media queries use min-width.

#### Filter By Category

You are able to sort both blog posts and portfolio projects by categories and titles. The data for each is pulled from a constructor, populated into two filters and jQuery is used to show and hide the sections searched.

#### Templating with Handlebars

Handlebars.js is used to template calls to the DOM for portfolio and blogs, and append the script templates directly to the main HTML page.
