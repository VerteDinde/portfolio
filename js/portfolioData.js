    body: '<p>I started a Javascript bootcamp with Code Fellows in February of 2017. In order to do this, I left a full-time job, and the full-time salary that came with it. One of the first things that I had to figure out was how to eat on a budget, and make my meals stretch throughout the week. How did we do this? Meal Prep Sunday, with recipes gathered and a massive grocery shop trip on Sunday to prep for all of the meals of the week.</p><p>This inspired a simple, fun side project - what if I could build an app that would let us pick from our favorite recipes, autogenerate a shopping list and let us check off those items at the grocery store in real time as my husband and I divided and conquered? Thus, the "Eat Slow" grocery list generator was born.</p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150"><p>Pudding lollipop dessert chocolate bar sugar plum.

    body: '<p>I’ve been an enthusiastic (if fairly slow) runner since I was in high school, and if there’s one thing us runners love, its our data. I have the privledge of winning the New York City Marathon\'s 2016 lottery, and so my husband and I took a trip to NYC last November, where I ran it in 4:31 - a PR for me!</p><p>When you\'re training for a marathon, you spend far too much time looking at training plans, reading about the 80-20 rule, negative splits, nutrition, pace zones - and just as importantly, finding out what every other runner is up to! I was curious how my fellow racers trained and performed, and so, <a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/01/26/london-marathon-visualising.html">inspired by this excellent post by Colin Eberhart</a>, I decided to try my first attempt at web scraping and analyze our race data.</p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150"><p>Pudding lollipop dessert chocolate bar sugar plum.
